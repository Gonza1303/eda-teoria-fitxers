THE RAVEN

LEAD VOCAL:  ALAN PARSONS, LEONARD WHITING

THE CLOCK STRUCK MIDNIGHT
AND THROUGH MY SLEEPING
I HEARD A TAPPING AT MY DOOR
I LOOKED BUT NOTHING LAY IN THE DARKNESS
AND SO I TURNED INSIDE ONCE MORE.
TO MY AMAZEMENT
THERE STOOD A RAVEN
WHOSE SHADOW HUNG ABOVE MY DOOR
THEN THROUGH THE DARKNESS
IT SPOKE THAT ONE WORD
THAT I SHALL HEAR FOREVER MORE.
NEVERMORE
THUS QUOTH THE RAVEN, NEVERMORE.
AND STILL THE RAVEN REMAINS IN MY ROOM
NO MATTER HOW MUCH I IMPLORE
NO WORDS CAN SOOTHE HIM
NO PRAYER REMOVE HIM
AND I MUST HEAR FOR EVERMORE
QUOTH THE RAVEN, NEVERMORE
THUS QUOTH THE RAVEN
NEVERMORE.
